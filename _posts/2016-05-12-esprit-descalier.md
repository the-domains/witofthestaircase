_esprit d'escalier_

the common experience that one's sharpest retorts occur to one only when the chance of uttering them is gone, the door is closed, and one's feet are halfway up the staircase. 

_spirit of the staircase_

is who is not already familiar with

_esprit d'escalier_

; and even he who is may not recognize it in disguise, seeing that

_esprit_

does not mean spirit (which suggests a goblin lurking in the hall clock), but wit.
