**Metallica, Chicago, Aragon Ballroom, February 3, 1985**

In 1985, I lived in Chicago in a apartment at 3233 N. Clifton Ave & Belmont Ave. It conveniently close to the Belmont EL stop, so it was easy for a regular cast of characters to show up at our place at all times of day and night.  
And it was a great location if liked to go see a lot of bands. Which we all did obsessively, or as much as we could afford to. Places like Tuts (later Avalon), the Cubby Bear, the Vic Theatre (favorite) were close by. 

The apartment I lived in with two other dudes, Danny and Robert, was party central for a regular cast of characters showing up at all times of day and night. The regulars, Robin, Laird (preppie, stoner), Flappy Head (painter, trustafarian ), Kevin (bass player, ), Johnny Bukrey (drummer, lover of Prince), Danny (looked like Billy Idol).
